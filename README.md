# Qtacker

Qtacker is a small puzzle game made in Unity.  
Your goal is to sort an **unordered input queue** into an **ordered output queue** by pushing and popping balls between three stacks.  
Whenever **three balls of the same colour** line up in the output queue they disappear, giving you points and more space.
